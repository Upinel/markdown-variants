This repository combined a few of the repositories I created in the past:

- markdown-cheatsheet
- mathjax-latex-md-mmd-pandoc
- pandoc-scripts or markdown-variants

I'm in the progress of cleaning them up and combining them together, because they are all different aspects of dealing with different variants of markdown. For the meanwhile if you need the old stuffs, please visit the [stable branch](https://github.com/ickc/markdown-variants/tree/stable).
